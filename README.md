# Sorting Algorithms Implementation

This document outlines the approach and implementation details for the sorting visualization project.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Implementation Approach

Each sorting algorithm is implemented as a separate component with visualization capabilities. The approach includes:

1. Array state management
2. Step-by-step visualization
3. Speed control for animations
4. Comparison of time and space complexity

## Data Structure

The visualization uses an array of numbers, represented as bars with heights proportional to their values.

## Technical Details

(Detailed technical implementation will be added as the project develops)
