# Sorting Algorithms Implementation

This project helps visualize various sorting algorithms to better understand how they work.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the sorting directory:
   ```
   cd sorting
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Implementation Approach

Each sorting algorithm is implemented as a separate component with visualization capabilities. The approach includes:

1. Array state management
2. Step-by-step visualization
3. Speed control for animations
4. Comparison of time and space complexity

For detailed information about the approach and implementation of the sorting algorithms, please refer to the [Sorting Implementation Documentation](./sorting/README.md).
