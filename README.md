# Sorting Algorithms Implementation

This document outlines the approach and implementation details for the sorting visualization project.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Implementation Approach

Each sorting algorithm is implemented as a separate component with visualization capabilities. The approach includes:

1. Array state management
2. Step-by-step visualization
3. Speed control for animations
4. Comparison of time and space complexity

## Data Structure

The visualization uses an array of numbers, represented as bars with heights proportional to their values.

## Technical Details

(Detailed technical implementation will be added as the project develops)
=======
# Sorting Visualizer

This project helps visualize various sorting algorithms to better understand how they work.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the sorting directory:
   ```
   cd sorting
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Approach and Implementation Details

For detailed information about the approach and implementation of the sorting algorithms, please refer to the [Sorting Implementation Documentation](./sorting/README.md).
